1- dart fix:
    dart fix --dry-run
    This command will analyze your code and show you the potential fixes without applying them.
    
    dart fix --apply
    This command will apply the fixes that were identified by the analysis.
    
    dart fix can automatically fix:
    Lint Issues: Code style improvements, deprecations, simplifications, and null safety enhancements.
    Migration Issues: Null safety migration, library updates, and syntax changes.
    It helps keep your Dart code clean, modern, and up-to-date.

2- dart format:
    To remove unused imports, you can use the command:
    dart format --fix .
    Or, you can use IDE features like "Organize Imports" in Visual Studio Code or Android Studio, which automatically remove unused imports.
